            <p class="pageArticle__chapoText">We are the only ones who can decide on our life, certainly, we will all die one day, but how will we use this time, this body and these capacities that we have?</p>

              <h2 class="pageArticle__sousTitre">A brake in our walk</h2>
              <blockquote class="pageArticle__quote">" Be yourself; everyone else is already taken." Oscar Wilde</blockquote>
              <p class="pageArticle__text">If there is one thing that prevents us from being ourselves, it is the influence of others, social <a class="internLink" href="glossaire.html">conformity</a>. Thus, following the herd instead of acting as we would have really wanted, for fear of being rejected by others, erases our true nature, and prevents us from expressing ourselves freely.</p>

              <div class="pageArticle__paragraphe">
                  <h2 class="pageArticle__sousTitre">Self-esteem</h2>
                  <blockquote class="pageArticle__quote">"Freedom is built every day, it constantly forces one to choose one's path, to watch over one's own destiny, to think, to be vigilant or energetic, to perform difficult actions." Jean Dutourd</blockquote>
                  <p class="pageArticle__text">It is important to get to know oneself in order to better define one's objectives in life. To no longer have to wear masks, to hide behind a false identity that conforms to society. It is necessary to know how to accept oneself fully and this also involves accepting to like what others do not like, because by erasing oneself too much, one can lose oneself and thus, no longer know who one really is, internally.</p>
                            
                <p class="pageArticle__text">
                    Today, this task is even more complicated in the age of social networks, because they are an integral part of our lives. Most people show what they are not, show only the good moments of their life, to the point that we have the impression that it is perfect. Everyone compares themselves, hides behind illusions of an ideal life. This kind of thing pushes us to invent better life conditions than the reality in order to maintain the same level and not to appear different and insignificant.
                </p>
                <p class="pageArticle__text">According to Sartre, alone, we can really be ourselves, but under the gaze of others, we lose our freedom and are no longer ourselves. Others see us as we are unable to see ourselves, that is, objectively. The gaze of others transforms us, in fact, when we give importance to what others think of us, we question our self-esteem. There is thus a crucial impact on the way we perceive ourselves.</p>

            <div class="pageArticle__paragraphe">
                <h2 class="pageArticle__sousTitre">Artistic expression</h2>
                <p class="pageArticle__text">Asserting oneself can be done through various forms of expression, art, for example, as the different characters discussed on this site have done. The Postman Cheval, Eléonore Herreinstein in La Voleuse des Toits, and Professor Keating in The Dead Poets Society are, for me, great examples of people who knew how to get past all this social conformity and stand out. They know how to be themselves, despite what others think.</p>
                    <p class="pageArticle__text">The Postman Cheval, for his part, realized his wildest dream, which took him years, and earned him the mockery and sarcasm of his contemporaries. In spite of this, he followed his destiny, the road he had traced for himself. He didn't do what was right at the time. The other two characters aspire to freedom and fulfillment, and do not intend to let society's norms prevent them from achieving these goals.</p>
                
                    <p class="pageArticle__text">It is, in a way, a message for the Samantha of the future. If I could address Her, I would tell Her to learn to be herself, to continue to search for herself, so that She can grow. I want Her to achieve Her dreams, Her goals, to do what She wants and not what others think she should do. But above all, that She can develop Her own personality, without letting Herself be molded by society.</p>
