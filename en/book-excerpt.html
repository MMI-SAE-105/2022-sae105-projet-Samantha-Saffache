                - Look around you, my child. Don't you see how much the world needs to be changed?</p>
            
                <p class="extrait__text">His words had remained engraved in her memory as the image of that night when, for the first time, she had broken the ban to venture onto the roofs. Taking advantage of a broken window, the girl had slipped into the house of this old man whose crime was to possess books. </p>
                <p class="extrait__text">Under a slat of the floor, she had discovered one of these forbidden objects, forgotten by the militia in their haste to destroy these writings of the past. The owner had chosen to preserve this book at the risk of his life. At the time, she did not understand the magnitude of this cause. How could anyone sacrifice themselves for a simple book? It was nothing more than paper... As she leafed through the yellowed pages of the book, a certainty had come over her. A truth that was not based on any evidence and that no argument to the contrary could shake. The world had not always been like this. In the past, people were free to think and these lines are a testimony to that time. It was worth dying to preserve the memory. </p>
            
                <p class="extrait__text">Plume had vowed to continue this fight. Alone, she could do nothing against society and the scarlet rules. But there was a freedom that would never fade. The freedom to dream... She had become a rooftop thief who, at nightfall, used the darkness to steal a piece of hope from the government. A piece of starry sky that she would slip under her pillow and accompany her in each of her dreams. Escaping from the militia and their patrols, Plume would venture into the slums to draw huge chalk paintings on the dull walls. His ephemeral works would disappear in the rain or be erased by the militia in the morning. The most important thing was to convey a message: the promise that a better world was possible.
